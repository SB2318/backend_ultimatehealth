## üöÄ Features

- 
  ### Article CRUD with edit request workflows 

  Managing content at scale requires a clear and controlled workflow to ensure quality, accuracy, and accountability. 
  This system outlines how articles are created, reviewed, and improved over time using a structured CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approach ‚Äî enriched by an edit request mechanism, inspired by proven         practices at platforms like **GeeksforGeeks**.

    (a) Submit Article for Review Process
        To maintain content quality, all newly created articles must go through a structured review process before publication.

    (b) Review Article Management Flow
        Editors or reviewers assess submitted articles, provide feedback, and approve or reject them based on content standards and accuracy.

    (c) Contributor Edit Requests
       After publication, any contributor can propose edits to an article. With the consent of the Admin team, contributors are allowed to begin work on those changes.

    (d) Edit Request Review Management Flow
      Once submitted, edit requests undergo a separate review process where they are evaluated, approved, or rejected by the review team to ensure continued content quality.

  
   
- ### Podcast CRUD And Review Workflows
